A lightweight **wallet activity simulator** for the **Celo blockchain**, designed for:

* 🔹 **Infrastructure testing** (RPCs, nodes, endpoints)
* 🔹 **Monitoring transaction throughput**
* 🔹 **Researching organic wallet behavior**
* 🔹 **Developer tooling & analytics**

---

## 📦 Features

* ✅ **In-memory encrypted private keys** (AES-256-GCM): Private keys are kept encrypted in memory and decrypted only when required for signing.
* ✅ **Multi-master key support & rotation**: `MASTER_KEY` with optional `BACKUP_KEYS` for recovery and key rotation.
* ✅ **Persona-driven wallet behavior** (`personas.json`): Configurable parameters include `idleBias`, `pingBias`, `activeHours`, `avgWait`, `retryBias`, `maxNonce`, and `device-agent`.
* ✅ **Device-agent support**: Per-wallet `User-Agent` and simulated latency to diversify fingerprints.
* ✅ **Configurable wait logic**: Adaptive/random spacing to mimic organic activity.
* ✅ **Multi-RPC rotation & proxy support**: Automatic failover across Celo RPC endpoints; supports HTTP(S) and SOCKS proxies (`proxy.txt`).
* ✅ **Adaptive activity patterns**: Dynamic `idleBias` based on recent success/failure history.
* ✅ **Structured CSV logging**: Daily rotated `tx_log_YYYY-MM-DD.csv` with buffered flushes.
* ✅ **Graceful shutdown**: Signal handlers flush logs and persist personas.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CryptoExplor/Celo-Wallet-Simulator.git
   cd Celo-Wallet-Simulator
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment**

   Create a local `.env` (for testing only — do NOT commit) with at minimum:

   ```bash
   PRIVATE_KEYS="0xabc...\n0xdef..."       # one key per line
   MASTER_KEY="your_master_passphrase"
   BACKUP_KEYS="oldMaster1,oldMaster2"     # optional
   ```

   Or set these as OS-level environment variables (recommended for production).

3. **(Optional) Add legacy key file**

   If you prefer legacy workflow, create `key.txt` with one private key per line — but `index.js` reads `PRIVATE_KEYS` env by default.

4. **Run the simulator**

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

5. **Stop gracefully**

   Press `Ctrl+C` — the process will flush logs and save persona state before exit.

## 🧩 Configuration & Files

* `index.js`: Main runtime engine (encryption, personas, RPC/proxy logic, tx loop).
* `personas.json`: Persona defaults (created automatically if missing). The simulator also supports encrypted persona storage.
* `inactive.json`: Stores addresses marked outside their active hours (can be encrypted on disk if enabled).
* `proxy.txt`: Optional: One proxy URL per line (`http(s)://host:port` or `socks5://host:port`).
* `key.txt`: Legacy: One private key per line (not required if using `PRIVATE_KEYS` env).
* `tx_log_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`: Daily CSV logs with header: `timestamp,wallet,tx_hash,nonce,gas_used,gas_price_gwei,fee_celo,status,action`.

## 🔒 Security Notes

* **MASTER_KEY** encrypts private keys in memory and is required at process start. Provide it via OS-level secrets or a secure vault in production.
* **BACKUP_KEYS** allow decrypting older encrypted blobs after key rotation. The script attempts decryption with all provided master keys.
* **Session salt** is used for stronger ephemeral key derivation. If you require persistent encrypted artifacts across runs, use per-key persistent salts stored with the ciphertext.
* **Encrypted personas/inactive storage**: The simulator supports encrypting `personas.json` and `inactive.json` on write and decrypting on load — enable this to protect persona metadata at rest.
* **Never commit** `.env`, `key.txt`, or any file containing real private keys to version control.
* Consider using HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or similar for production secrets.

## 🕵️ Device Agent & Fake Latency

* Each persona can include a `deviceAgent` object containing a `userAgent` string and a `latency` value (ms). The simulator uses `userAgent` when making HTTP/RPC calls where custom headers are supported and applies `latency` as a simulated network delay before/after RPC calls to diversify network footprints.
* Device agents are persisted in personas (and can be encrypted on disk) so wallets keep consistent fingerprinting unless rotated deliberately.

---

## ⚙️ Adaptive Activity Patterns

* The simulator keeps simple success/failure counters per persona (`txSuccessCount`, `txFailCount`) and uses those to **adjust `idleBias` dynamically**.
* If a wallet experiences repeated failures, `idleBias` increases to reduce activity (saving gas and avoiding repeated failures). When success rate improves, `idleBias` lowers to resume normal activity.

---

## 📈 Logging & Observability

* Transaction logs are buffered and flushed to daily CSV files every 5 minutes (configurable).
* Consider integrating metrics or a dashboard (Prometheus / Grafana) for real-time monitoring and alerts (RPC failures, wallet depletion, repeated tx failures).

---

## 🛠️ Extensibility & Next Steps

Suggested improvements:

* Encrypted persona & inactive storage (implemented/optional)
* Persistent per-key salts for long-term encrypted artifacts
* Dashboard & metrics for live monitoring
* Stable proxy-per-wallet assignment to simulate consistent geolocation
